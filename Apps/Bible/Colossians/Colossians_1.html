        1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our
        brother,
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        2 To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ <i>who are</i> in
        Colosse:<br />
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
      </p>

      <h4 class="bookHeading">Their Faith in Christ</h4>
      <p class="book">
        3 We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying
        always for you,
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        4 since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of your love for all
        the saints;
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        5 because of the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, of which you
        heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel,
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        6 which has come to you, as <i>it has</i> also in all the world, and is
        bringing forth fruit, as <i>it is</i> also among you since the day you
        heard and knew the grace of God in truth;
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        7 as you also learned from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a
        faithful minister of Christ on your behalf,
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        8 who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.

      <h4 class="bookHeading">Preeminence of Christ</h4>
      <p class="book">
        9 For this reason we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to
        pray for you, and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of
        His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        10 that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing <i>Him</i>,
        being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of
        God;
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        11 strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, for all
        patience and longsuffering with joy;

      <p class="bookLeft">
        12 giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of
        the inheritance of the saints in the light.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        13 He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed <i>us</i>
        into the kingdom of the Son of His love,
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        14 in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of
        sins.
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        15 He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all
        creation.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        16 For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on
        earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or
        principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for
        Him.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        17 And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        18 And He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the
        firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence.
      </p>

      <h4 class="bookHeading">Reconciled in Christ</h4>
      <p class="book">
        19 For it pleased <i>the Father that</i> in Him all the fullness should
        dwell,
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        20 and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him, whether things
        on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His
        cross.

        works, yet now He has reconciled
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        22 in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy, and

        minister.

        24 I now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up in my flesh what
