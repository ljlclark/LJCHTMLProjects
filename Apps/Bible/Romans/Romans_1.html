        8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith
        is spoken of throughout the whole world.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        9 &nbsp;
        For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His
        Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers,
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        10 making request if, by some means, now at last I may find a way in the
        will of God to come to you.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        11 For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift,
        so that you may be established-
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        12 that is, that I may be encouraged together with you by the mutual

      </p>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p class="hanging">
        13 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        Now I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that I often planned
        to come to you (but was hindered until now), that I might have some
        fruit among you also, just as among the other Gentiles.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        14 I am a debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to
        unwise.

        15 So, as much as is in me, <i>I am</i> ready to preach the gospel to

      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p class="hanging">
        16 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of
        God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also
        for the Greek.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        17 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith;

        18 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
        and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        19 because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has
        shown <i>it</i> to them.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        20 For since the creation of the world His invisible <i>attributes</i>
        are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made,
        <i>even</i> His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without
        excuse,
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        21 because, although they knew God, they did not glorify <i>Him</i> as
        God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their
        foolish hearts were darkened.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        22 Professing to be wise, they became fools,
