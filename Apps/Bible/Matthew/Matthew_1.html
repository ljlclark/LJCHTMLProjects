        18 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His
        mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came
        together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        19 Then Joseph her husband, being a <i>just</i> man, and
        not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put
        her away secretly.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        20 But while he thought about these things, behold, an
        angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying,
        "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary
        your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the
        Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        21 "And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His
        name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins."
      </p>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p class="hanging">
        22 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which
        was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        23 "<i>Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son,</i>
        <i>and they shall call His name Immanuel</i>", which is translated,
        "God with us."
