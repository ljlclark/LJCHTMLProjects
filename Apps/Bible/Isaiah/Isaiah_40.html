        "Comfort, yes, comfort My people!"<br />
        Says your God.

        "Speak comfort to Jerusalem, and cry out to her,<br />
        That her warfare is ended,<br />
        That her iniquity is pardoned;<br />
        For she has received from the LORD's hand<br />
        Double for all her sins."

      <p class="hanging">
        3 &nbsp;
        The voice of one crying in the wilderness:<br />
        "Prepare the way of the LORD;<br />
        Make straight in the desert<br />
        A highway for our God.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        4 &nbsp;
        Every valley shall be exalted<br />
        And every mountain and hill brought low;<br />
        The crooked places shall be made straight<br />
        And the rough places smooth;
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        5 &nbsp;
        The glory of the LORD shall be revealed,<br />
        And all flesh shall see <i>it</i> together;<br />
        For the mouth of the LORD has spoken."
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        6 &nbsp;
        The voice said, "Cry out!"<br />
        And he (I) said, "What shall I cry?"<br />
        <br />
        "All flesh <i>is</i> grass,<br />
        And all its loveliness <i>is</i> like the flower of the field.

      <p class="hanging">
        7 &nbsp;
        The grass withers, the flower fades,<br />
        Because the breath of the LORD blows upon it;<br />
        Surely the people <i>are</i> grass.

      <p class="hanging">
        8 &nbsp;
        The grass withers, the flower fades,<br />

        O Zion,<br />
        You who bring good tidings,<br />
        Get up into the high mountain;<br />
        O Jerusalem,<br />
        You who bring good tidings,<br />
        Lift up your voice with strength,<br />
        Lift it up, be not afraid;<br />
        Say to the cities of Judah, "Behold your God!"

        10 Behold, the Lord GOD shall come with a strong <i>hand</i>,<br />

        Behold, His reward <i>is</i> with Him,<br />
        And His work before Him.

      <p class="hanging">
        11 He will feed His flock like a shepherd;<br />
        He will gather the lambs with His arm,<br />
        And carry them in His bosom,<br />
        And gently lead those who are with young.

        12 Who has measured the waters (of the sea) in the hollow of His hand,
        <br />
        Measured heaven with a span<br />

        Weighed the mountains in scales<br />
        And the hills in a balance?
