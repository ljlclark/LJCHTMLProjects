        26 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of
        Galilee named Nazareth,
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        27 to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of
        David. The virgin’s name <i>was</i> Mary.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        28 And having come in, the angel said to her, "Rejoice, highly favored
        <i>one</i>, the Lord is with you; blessed <i>are</i> you among women!"
      </p>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p class="hanging">
        29 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        But when she saw <i>him</i>, she was troubled at his saying, and
        considered what manner of greeting this was.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        30 Then the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have
        found favor with God.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        31 "And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son,
        and shall call His name JESUS.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        32 "He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the
        Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        33 "And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His
        kingdom there will be no end.”
      </p>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p class="hanging">
        34 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        Then Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, since I do not know a
        man?"
      </p>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p class="hanging">
        35 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        And the angel answered and said to her, "<i>The</i> Holy Spirit will
        come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you;
        therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son
        of God.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        36 "Now indeed, Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her
        old age; and this is now the sixth month for her who was called barren.

      <p class="hanging">
        37 "For with God nothing will be impossible."
