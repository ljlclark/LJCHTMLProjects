        And you <i>He made alive</i>, who were dead in trespasses and sins,
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        2 &nbsp;
        in which you once walked according to the course of this world,
        according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now
        works in the sons of disobedience,
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        3 &nbsp;
        among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our
        flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by
        nature children of wrath, just as the others.
      </p>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p class="hanging">
        4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He
        loved us,
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        5 &nbsp;
        even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ

        and raised <i>us</i> up together, and made <i>us</i> sit together in the

      <p class="hanging">
        8 &nbsp;
        For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of

      <p class="hanging">
        9 &nbsp;
        not of works, lest anyone should boast.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works,
        which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.

        11 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        Therefore remember that you, once Gentiles in the flesh- who are
        called Uncircumcision by what is called the Circumcision made in the
        flesh by hands-
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        12 that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the
        commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise,
        having no hope and without God in the world.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought
        near by the blood of Christ.

      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p class="hanging">
        14 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken
        down the middle wall of separation,
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        15 having abolished in His flesh the enmity, <i>that is</i>, the law of
        commandments <i>contained</i> in ordinances, so as to create in Himself
        one new man <i>from</i> the two, <i>thus</i> making peace,
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        16 and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the
        cross, thereby putting to death the enmity.

      <p class="hanging">
        17 And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those
        who were near.

        18 For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.

        Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow
        citizens with the saints and members of the household of God,
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        20 having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
        Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner<i>stone</i>,

        21 in whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy
        temple in the Lord,

        22 in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place of
        God in the Spirit.
