      <p class="book">
        1 There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        2 This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, "Rabbi, we know that
        You are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that You
        do unless God is with him."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        3 Jesus answered and said to him, "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless
        one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        4 Nicodemus said to Him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he
        enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?"
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        5 Jesus answered, "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of
        water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        6 "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of
        the Spirit is spirit.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        7 "Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        8 "The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but
        cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who
        is born of the Spirit."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        9 Nicodemus answered and said to Him, "How can these things be?"
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        10 Jesus answered and said to him, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and
        do not know these things?
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        11 "Most assuredly, I say to you, We speak what We know and testify what
        We have seen, and you do not receive Our witness.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        12 "If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will
        you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        13 "No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that
        is, the Son of Man who is in heaven.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        14 "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must
        the Son of Man be lifted up,
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        15 "that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal
        life.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        16 "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that
        whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        17 "For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world,
        but that the world through Him might be saved.
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        18 "He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe
        is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the
        only begotten Son of God.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        19 "And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the
        world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds
        were evil.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        20 "For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to
        the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        21 "But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be
        clearly seen, that they have been done in God."

        22 After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of
        Judea, and there He remained with them and baptized.

        23 Now John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was

        25 Then there arose a dispute between some of John's disciples and the
        Jews about purification.

        26 And they came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, He who was with you
