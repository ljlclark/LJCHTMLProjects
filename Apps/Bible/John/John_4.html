      <h4 class="bookHeading">A Samaritan Woman Meets Her Messiah</h4>
      <p class="book">
        1 Therefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus
        made and baptized more disciples than John
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        2 (though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples),
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        3 He left Judea and departed again to Galilee.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        4 But He needed to go through Samaria.
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        5 So He came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot
        of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        6 Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from
        <i>His</i> journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        7 A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give Me a
        drink."
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        8 For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        9 Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, "How is it that You, being a
        Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?" For Jews have no dealings
        with Samaritans.
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        10 Jesus answered and said to her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who
        it is who says to you, 'Give Me a drink,' you would have asked Him, and
        He would have given you living water."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        11 The woman said to Him, "Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the
        well is deep. Where then do You get that living water?
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        12 "Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and
        drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock?"
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        13 Jesus answered and said to her, "Whoever drinks of this water will
        thirst again,
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        14 "but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never
        thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a
        fountain of water springing up into everlasting life."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        15 The woman said to Him, "Sir, give me this water, that I may not
        thirst, nor come here to draw."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        16 Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come here."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        17 The woman answered and said, "I have no husband." Jesus said to her,
        "You have well said, 'I have no husband,'
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        18 "for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not
        your husband; in that you spoke truly."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        19 The woman said to Him, "Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        20 "Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you Jews say that in
        Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        21 Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you
        will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        22 "You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for
        salvation is of the Jews.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        23 "But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will
        worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such
        to worship Him.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        24 "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and
        truth."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        25 The woman said to Him, "I know that Messiah is coming" (who is called
        Christ). "When He comes, He will tell us all things."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        26 Jesus said to her, "I who speak to you am <i>He</i>."
      </p>

      <h4 class="bookHeading">The Whitened Harvest</h4>
      <p class="book">
        27 And at this point His disciples came, and they marveled that He
        talked with a woman; yet no one said, "What do You seek?" or, "Why
        are You talking with her?"
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        28 The woman then left her waterpot, went her way into the city, and
        said to the men,
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        29 "Come, see a Man who told me all things that I ever did. Could this
        be the Christ?"
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        30 Then they went out of the city and came to Him.
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        31 In the meantime His disciples urged Him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        32 But He said to them, "I have food to eat of which you do not know."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        33 Therefore the disciples said to one another, "Has anyone brought Him
        <i>anything</i> to eat?"

    John 4:34-54<br />
    <br />  <!-- Not used if followed by heading. -->
    <div class="columns">
      <p class="book">
        34 Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me,
        and to finish His work.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        35 "Do you not say, 'There are still four months and <i>then</i> comes
        the harvest'? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the
        fields, for they are already white for harvest!
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        36 “And he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life,
        that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        37 "For in this the saying is true: 'One sows and another reaps.'
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        38 "I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have
        labored, and you have entered into their labors."
      </p>

      <h4 class="bookHeading">The Savior of the World</h4>
      <p class="book">
        39 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in Him because of
        the word of the woman who testified, "He told me all that I <i>ever</i>
        did."
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        40 So when the Samaritans had come to Him, they urged Him to stay with
        them; and He stayed there two days.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        41 And many more believed because of His own word.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        42 Then they said to the woman, "Now we believe, not because of what you
        said, for we ourselves have heard <i>Him</i> and we know that this is
        indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world."
      </p>

      <h4 class="bookHeading">Welcome at Galilee</h4>
      <p class="book">
        43 Now after the two days He departed from there and went to Galilee.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        44 For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own
        country.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        45 So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen
        all the things He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they also had gone
        to the feast.
      </p>

      <h4 class="bookHeading">A Nobleman’s Son Healed</h4>
      <p class="book">
        46 So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water
        wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        47 When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went
        to Him and implored Him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the
        point of death.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        48 Then Jesus said to him, "Unless you <i>people</i> see signs and
        wonders, you will by no means believe."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        49 The nobleman said to Him, "Sir, come down before my child dies!"
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        50 Jesus said to him, "Go your way; your son lives." So the man believed
        the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        51 And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told him,
        saying, "Your son lives!"
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        52 Then he inquired of them the hour when he got better. And they said
        to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        53 So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said
        to him, "Your son lives." And he himself believed, and his whole
        household.
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        54 This again <i>is</i> the second sign Jesus did when He had come out
        of Judea into Galilee.
