        Therefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus
        made and baptized more disciples than John

        So He came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot
        of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

      <p class="hanging">
        6 &nbsp;
        Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from
        <i>His</i> journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.

        A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give Me a
        drink."

        Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, "How is it that You, being a
        Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?" For Jews have no dealings
        with Samaritans.
      </p>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p class="hanging">
        10 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        Jesus answered and said to her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who
        it is who says to you, 'Give Me a drink,' you would have asked Him, and
        He would have given you living water."

      <p class="hanging">
        12 "Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and

      <p class="hanging">
        13 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        Jesus answered and said to her, "Whoever drinks of this water will

        14 "but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never

        Now after the two days He departed from there and went to Galilee.

        So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water

      <p class="hanging">
        47 When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went

      <p class="hanging">
        51 And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told him,

        52 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        Then he inquired of them the hour when he got better. And they said

        53 So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said
