      <h4 class="bookHeading">A Man Healed at the Pool of Bethesda</h4>
      <p class="book">
        1 After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to
        Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        2 Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep <i>Gate</i> a pool, which is
        called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        3 In these lay a great multitude of sick people, blind, lame, paralyzed,
        waiting for the moving of the water.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        4 For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and stirred up
        the water; then whoever stepped in first, after the stirring of the
        water, was made well of whatever disease he had.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        5 Now a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        6 When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he already had been
        <i>in that condition</i> a long time, He said to him, "Do you want to be
        made well?"
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        7 The sick man answered Him, "Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool
        when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down
        before me."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        8 Jesus said to him, "Rise, take up your bed and walk."
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        9 And immediately the man was made well, took up his bed, and walked.
        And that day was the Sabbath.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        10 The Jews therefore said to him who was cured, "It is the Sabbath; it
        is not lawful for you to carry your bed."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        11 He answered them, "He who made me well said to me, 'Take up your bed
        and walk.'"
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        12 Then they asked him, "Who is the Man who said to you, 'Take up your
        bed and walk'?"
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        13 But the one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had
        withdrawn, a multitude being in <i>that</i> place.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        14 Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, "See, you
        have been made well. Sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon you."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        15 The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him
        well.
      </p>

      <h4 class="bookHeading">Honor the Father and the Son</h4>
      <p class="book">
        16 For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill Him,
        because He had done these things on the Sabbath.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        17 But Jesus answered them, "My Father has been working until now, and
        I have been working."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        18 Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not
        only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was His Father, making
        Himself equal with God.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        19 Then Jesus answered and said to them, "Most assuredly, I say to you,
        the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for
        whatever He does, the Son also does in like manner.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        20 "For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He
        Himself does; and He will show Him greater works than these, that you
        may marvel.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        21 "For as the Father raises the dead and gives life to them, even so
        the Son gives life to whom He will.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        22 "For the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the
        Son,
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        23 "that all should honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who
        does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.
      </p>

      <h4 class="bookHeading">Life and Judgment Are Through the Son</h4>
      <p class="book">
        24 "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in
        Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment,
        but has passed from death into life.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        25 "Most assuredly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when
        the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will
        live.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        26 "For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to
        have life in Himself,
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        27 "and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is
        the Son of Man.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        28 "Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are
        in the graves will hear His voice

        30 "I can of Myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is

      <p class="bookLeft">
        36 "But I have a greater witness than John’s; for the works which the
        Father has given Me to finish- the very works that I do- bear witness of
        Me, that the Father has sent Me.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
