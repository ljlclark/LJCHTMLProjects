        But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        2 &nbsp;
        Now early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the
        people came to Him; and He sat down and taught them.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        3 &nbsp;
        Then the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in
        adultery. And when they had set her in the midst,
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        4 &nbsp;
        they said to Him, "Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the
        very act.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        5 &nbsp;
        "Now Moses, in the law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But
        what do You say?"
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        6 &nbsp;
        This they said, testing Him, that they might have <i>something</i> of
        which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with
        <i>His</i> finger, as though He did not hear.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        7 &nbsp;
        So when they continued asking Him, He raised Himself up and said to
        them, "He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her
        first."
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        8 &nbsp;
        And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        9 &nbsp;
        Then those who heard <i>it</i>, being convicted by <i>their</i>
        conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest <i>even</i>
        to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the
        midst.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        10 When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He
        said to her, "Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Has no one
        condemned you?"
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        11 She said, "No one, Lord." And Jesus said to her, "Neither do I
        condemn you; go and sin no more."
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        12 Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, "I am the light of the world.
        He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of
        life."

      <p class="hanging">
        13 The Pharisees therefore said to Him, "You bear witness of Yourself;
        Your witness is not true."
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        14 Jesus answered and said to them, "Even if I bear witness of Myself,
        My witness is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going;
        but you do not know where I come from and where I am going.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        15 "You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        16 "And yet if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I <i>am</i> not alone,
        but I am with the Father who sent Me.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        17 "It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is
        true.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        18 "I am One who bears witness of Myself, and the Father who sent Me
        bears witness of Me.”
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        19 Then they said to Him, "Where is Your Father?" Jesus answered, "You
        know neither Me nor My Father. If you had known Me, you would have known
        My Father also."
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        20 These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple;
        and no one laid hands on Him, for His hour had not yet come.

        21 Then Jesus said to them again, "I am going away, and you will seek
        Me, and will die in your sin. Where I go you cannot come."
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        22 So the Jews said, "Will He kill Himself, because He says, 'Where I go
        you cannot come'?"
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        23 And He said to them, "You are from beneath; I am from above. You are
        of this world; I am not of this world.

      <p class="hanging">
        25 Then they said to Him, "Who are You?" And Jesus said to them, "Just

        26 "I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but He who

        27 They did not understand that He spoke to them of the Father.

      <p class="hanging">
        28 Then Jesus said to them, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you
