      <p class="hanging">
        1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the
        mother of Jesus was there.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        2 &nbsp;
        Now both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        3 &nbsp;
        And when they ran out of wine, the mother of Jesus said to Him, "They
        have no wine."
      </p>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p class="hanging">
        4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Jesus said to her, "Woman, what does your concern have to do with Me?
        My hour has not yet come."
      </p>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p class="hanging">
        5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        His mother said to the servants, "Whatever He says to you, do
        <i>it</i>."
      </p>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p class="hanging">
        6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Now there were set there six waterpots of stone, according to the
        manner of purification of the Jews, containing twenty or thirty gallons
        a piece.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        7 &nbsp;
        Jesus said to them, "Fill the waterpots with water." And they filled
        them up to the brim.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        8 &nbsp;
        And He said to them, "Draw <i>some</i> out now, and take <i>it</i> to
        the master of the feast." And they took <i>it</i>.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        9 &nbsp;
        When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine,
        and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the
        water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        10 And he said to him, "Every man at the beginning sets out the good
        wine, and when the <i>guests</i> have well drunk, then the inferior. You
        have kept the good wine until now!"
      </p>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p class="hanging">
        11 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested
        His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.
      </p>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p class="hanging">
        12 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        After this He went down to Capernaum, He, His mother, His brothers,
        and His disciples; and they did not stay there many days.

        Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to
        Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        14 And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves,
        and the money changers doing business.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        15 When He had made a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the
        temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers’ money
        and overturned the tables.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        16 And He said to those who sold doves, "Take these things away! Do not
        make My Father's house a house of merchandise!"
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        17 Then His disciples remembered that it was written, "<i>
          Zeal for Your
          house has eaten Me up

        So the Jews answered and said to Him, "What sign do You show to us,
        since You do these things?"
      </p>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p class="hanging">
        19 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        Jesus answered and said to them, "Destroy this temple, and in three
        days I will raise it up."
      </p>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p class="hanging">
        20 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        Then the Jews said, "It has taken forty-six years to build this
        temple, and will You raise it up in three days?"
      </p>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p class="hanging">
        21 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        But He was speaking of the temple of His body.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        22 Therefore, when He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered
        that He had said this to them; and they believed the Scripture and the
        word which Jesus had said.

        Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many
        believed in His name when they saw the signs which He did.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        24 But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew all
        <i>men</i>,
