        After these things Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee, which is <i>

        Then a great multitude followed Him, because they saw His signs which

        Then Jesus lifted up <i>His</i> eyes, and seeing a great multitude

        these may eat?"

        Philip answered Him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not

        One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him,

        Then Jesus said, "Make the people sit down." Now there was much grass
        in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        11 And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks He
        distributed <i>them</i> to the disciples, and the disciples to those
        sitting down; and likewise of the fish, as much as they wanted.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        12 So when they were filled, He said to His disciples, "Gather up the
        fragments that remain, so that nothing is lost."
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        13 Therefore they gathered <i>them</i> up, and filled twelve baskets
        with the fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over by
        those who had eaten.
      </p>
      <p class="hanging">
        14 Then those men, when they had seen the sign that Jesus did, said,

        Therefore when Jesus perceived that they were about to come and take
        Him by force to make Him king, He departed again to the mountain by
        Himself alone.

        Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,

        18 Then the sea arose because a great wind was blowing.

      <p class="hanging">
        19 So when they had rowed about three or four miles,[fn] they saw Jesus
        walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were afraid.

      <p class="hanging">
        20 But He said to them, "It is I; do not be afraid."

        21 Then they willingly received Him into the boat, and immediately the
        boat was at the land where they were going.

        On the following day, when the people who were standing on the other

        which His disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered the boat
        with His disciples, but His disciples had gone away alone-

      <p class="hanging">
        23 however, other boats came from Tiberias, near the place where they
        ate bread after the Lord had given thanks-

      <p class="hanging">
        24 when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor His
        disciples, they also got into boats and came to Capernaum, seeking
        Jesus.

      <p class="hanging">
        25 And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to
        Him, "Rabbi, when did You come here?"

      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p class="hanging">
        26 &nbsp;&nbsp;
        Jesus answered them and said, "Most assuredly, I say to you, you seek
        Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves and
        were filled.
