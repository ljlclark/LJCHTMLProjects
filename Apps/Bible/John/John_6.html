        1 After these things Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee, which is <i>
          the Sea
        </i> of Tiberias.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        2 Then a great multitude followed Him, because they saw His signs which
        He performed on those who were diseased.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        3 And Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat with His
        disciples.
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        4 Now the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        5 Then Jesus lifted up <i>His</i> eyes, and seeing a great multitude
        coming toward Him, He said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread, that
        these may eat?"
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        6 But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He would do.
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        7 Philip answered Him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not
        sufficient for them, that every one of them may have a little."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        8 One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him,
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        9 "There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish,
        but what are they among so many?"
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        10 Then Jesus said, "Make the people sit down." Now there was much grass
        in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        11 And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks He
        distributed <i>them</i> to the disciples, and the disciples to those
        sitting down; and likewise of the fish, as much as they wanted.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        12 So when they were filled, He said to His disciples, "Gather up the
        fragments that remain, so that nothing is lost."
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        13 Therefore they gathered <i>them</i> up, and filled twelve baskets
        with the fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over by
        those who had eaten.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        14 Then those men, when they had seen the sign that Jesus did, said,
        "This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world."

      <p class="book">
        15 Therefore when Jesus perceived that they were about to come and take
        Him by force to make Him king, He departed again to the mountain by
        Himself alone.
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        16 Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        17 got into the boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was
        already dark, and Jesus had not come to them.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        18 Then the sea arose because a great wind was blowing.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        19 So when they had rowed about three or four miles,[fn] they saw Jesus
        walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were afraid.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        20 But He said to them, "It is I; do not be afraid."
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        21 Then they willingly received Him into the boat, and immediately the
        boat was at the land where they were going.

      <p class="book">
        22 On the following day, when the people who were standing on the other
        side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except that one
        which His disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered the boat
        with His disciples, but His disciples had gone away alone-
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        23 however, other boats came from Tiberias, near the place where they
        ate bread after the Lord had given thanks-
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        24 when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor His
        disciples, they also got into boats and came to Capernaum, seeking
        Jesus.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        25 And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to
        Him, "Rabbi, when did You come here?"
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        26 Jesus answered them and said, "Most assuredly, I say to you, you seek
        Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves and
        were filled.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        27 "Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which
        endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, because
        God the Father has set His seal on Him."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        28 Then they said to Him, "What shall we do, that we may work the works
        of God?"
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        29 Jesus answered and said to them, "This is the work of God, that you
