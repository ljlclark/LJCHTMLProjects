      <h4 class="bookHeading">Jesus' Brothers Disbelieve</h4>
      <p class="book">
        1 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for He did not want to
        walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill Him.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        2 Now the Jews' Feast of Tabernacles was at hand.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        3 His brothers therefore said to Him, "Depart from here and go into
        Judea, that Your disciples also may see the works that You are doing.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        4 "For no one does anything in secret while he himself seeks to be known
        openly. If You do these things, show Yourself to the world."
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        5 For even His brothers did not believe in Him.
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        6 Then Jesus said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is
        always ready.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        7 "The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify of it
        that its works are evil.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        8 "You go up to this feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, for My
        time has not yet fully come."
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        9 When He had said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        10 But when His brothers had gone up, then He also went up to the feast,
        not openly, but as it were in secret.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        11 Then the Jews sought Him at the feast, and said, "Where is He?"
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        12 And there was much complaining among the people concerning Him. Some
        said, "He is good"; others said, "No, on the contrary, He deceives the
        people."
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        13 However, no one spoke openly of Him for fear of the Jews.
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        14 Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and
        taught.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        15 And the Jews marveled, saying, "How does this Man know letters,
        having never studied?"
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        16 Jesus answered them and said, "My doctrine is not Mine, but His who
        sent Me.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        17 "If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the
        doctrine, <i>whether</i> it is from God or whether I speak on My own
        <i>authority</i>.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        18 "He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the
        glory of the One who sent Him is true, and no unrighteousness is in Him.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        19 "Did not Moses give you the law, yet none of you keeps the law? Why
        do you seek to kill Me?"
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        20 The people answered and said, "You have a demon. Who is seeking to
        kill You?"
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        21 Jesus answered and said to them, "I did one work, and you all marvel.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        22 "Moses therefore gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses,
        but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        23 "If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath, so that the law of
        Moses should not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made a man
        completely well on the Sabbath?
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        24 "Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous
        judgment."
      </p>

      <p class="book">
        25 Now some of them from Jerusalem said, "Is this not He whom they seek
        to kill?
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        26 "But look! He speaks boldly, and they say nothing to Him. Do the
        rulers know indeed that this is truly the Christ?
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        27 "However, we know where this Man is from; but when the Christ comes,
        no one knows where He is from."
      </p>
      <p class="book">
        28 Then Jesus cried out, as He taught in the temple, saying, "You both
        know Me, and you know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself,
        but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.

        31 And many of the people believed in Him, and said, "When the Christ

        32 The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things concerning Him,
        and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take Him.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        33 Then Jesus said to them, "I shall be with you a little while longer,

        35 Then the Jews said among themselves, "Where does He intend to go that
        we shall not find Him? Does He intend to go to the Dispersion among the
        Greeks and teach the Greeks?
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        36 "What is this thing that He said, 'You will seek Me and not find Me,

      <p class="book">
        37 On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried
        out, saying, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.

      <p class="bookLeft">
        38 "He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart

      <p class="bookLeft">
        39 But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him
        would receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was
        not yet glorified.

        41 Others said, "This is the Christ." But some said, "Will the Christ
