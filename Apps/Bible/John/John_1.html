        1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
        Word was God.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        2 He was in the beginning with God.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        3 All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made
        that was made.

      <p class="bookLeft">
        4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.

      <h4 class="bookHeading">The True Light</h4>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        7 This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all
        through him might believe.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        8 He was not that Light, but was <i>sent</i> to bear witness of that
        Light.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        9 That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into
        the world.<span><sup id="b">{b}</sup></span>
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        10 He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the
        world did not know Him.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        11 He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become
        children of God, to those who believe in His name:
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        13 who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
        the will of man, but of God.
      </p>

      <h4 class="bookHeading">The Word Becomes Flesh</h4>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His
        glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace
        and truth.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        15 John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, "This was He of whom
        I said, 'He who comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before
        me.'"
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        16 And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        17 For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through
        Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        18 No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the
        bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.

      <p class="bookLeft">
        19 Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and
        Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        20 He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ."
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        21 And they asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not."
        "Are you the Prophet?" And he answered, "No."
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        22 Then they said to him, "Who are you, that we may give an answer to
        those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?"
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        23 He said: "I am<br />
        <br />
        'The voice of one crying in the wilderness:<br />
        "Make straight the way of the LORD,"'<br />
        as the prophet Isaiah said."<br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        24 Now those who were sent were from the Pharisees.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        25 And they asked him, saying, "Why then do you baptize if you are not
        the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"

        26 John answered them, saying, "I baptize with water, but there stands
        One among you whom you do not know.

      <p class="bookLeft">
        27 "It is He who, coming after me, is preferred before me, whose sandal
        strap I am not worthy to loose."
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        28 These things were done in Bethabara beyond the Jordan, where John was
        baptizing.

      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, "Behold! The
        Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        30 "This is He of whom I said, 'After me comes a Man who is preferred
        before me, for He was before me.'
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        31 "I did not know Him; but that He should be revealed to Israel,
        therefore I came baptizing with water."
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        32 And John bore witness, saying, "I saw the Spirit descending from
        heaven like a dove, and He remained upon Him.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        33 "I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water said to
        me, 'Upon whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, this
        is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        34 "And I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God."
      </p>

      <h4 class="bookHeading">The First Disciples</h4>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        35 Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        36 And looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, "Behold the Lamb of God!"
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        37 The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        38 Then Jesus turned, and seeing them following, said to them, "What do
        you seek?" They said to Him, "Rabbi" (which is to say, when translated,
        Teacher), "where are You staying?"
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        39 He said to them, "Come and see." They came and saw where He was
        staying, and remained with Him that day (now it was about the tenth
        hour).
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        40 One of the two who heard John speak, and followed Him, was Andrew,
        Simon Peter’s brother.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        41 He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, "We have found
        the Messiah" (which is translated, the Christ).
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        42 And he brought him to Jesus. Now when Jesus looked at him, He said,
        "You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas" (which
        is translated, A Stone).
      </p>

      <h4 class="bookHeading">Philip and Nathanael</h4>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        43 The following day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee, and He found Philip
        and said to him, "Follow Me."
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        45 Philip found Nathanael and said to him, "We have found Him of whom
        Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the
        son of Joseph."
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        46 And Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"
        Philip said to him, "Come and see."
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, and said of him, "Behold, an
        Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!"
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        48 Nathanael said to Him, "How do You know me?" Jesus answered and said
        to him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I
        saw you."
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        49 Nathanael answered and said to Him, "Rabbi, You are the Son of God!
        You are the King of Israel!"
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        50 Jesus answered and said to him, "Because I said to you, 'I saw you
        under the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than
        these."
      </p>
      <p class="bookLeft">
        51 And He said to him, "Most assuredly, I say to you, hereafter you
        shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending
        upon the Son of Man."
